In simple words **bigdesk** makes it very easy to see how your elasticsearch cluster is doing. Just install it as an [elasticsearch plugin](#elasticsearch_plugin), [download locally](#download_locally) or run [online from the web](#online_from_the_web), then point it to the elasticsearch node REST endpoint and **have fun**.

It pulls data from elasticsearch REST API and turns it into charts.

Currently, bigdesk **master** supports elasticsearch **0.19** and **0.20** (if you are using elasticsearch **0.17** and **0.18** then use bigdesk **1.0.0**).

### online from the web

You can also run bigdesk directly from the web without needing to install it. Just [select the version](v) you want to use and you are ready to go.

### URL parameters

You can use URL parameters to immediately **connect** to a particular **endpoint** or set **history** and **refresh** interval:

##### &mdash; endpoint
URL of elasticsearch node REST endpoint (you might want to use URL encoded value). Defaults to `http://localhost:9200`.

##### &mdash; connect
If set to `true` bigdesk will try to connect immediately to the endpoint. Defaults to `false`.

##### &mdash; refresh
Refresh interval in milliseconds. Defaults to `2000` (2 sec).

##### &mdash; history
How much data in milliseconds to keep in history. Defaults to `300000` (5 min).

For example, to open bigdesk and have it connect to `http://127.0.0.1:9201` endpoint with a `3` sec refresh interval use:

`index.html?endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:9201&connect=true&refresh=3000`

Check [here](https://github.com/lukas-vlcek/bigdesk/blob/0.18.x/README.textile) about supported URL parameters by bigdesk 1.0.0. 

### web browser support
